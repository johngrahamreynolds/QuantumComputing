## Repo housing info related to Quantum Computing


#### The Canonical_algorithms folder houses various examples of well understood quantum algorithms that I have implemented in Cirq with short descrition

#### The embedded colabs within this folder can all be exported from my GitHub to a Google colab environment for execution by opening any of the .ipynb files and changing the URL from github.com to githubtocolab.com
