        "For the general case of any integer n greater than one, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can still solve this problem with only a single query to the oracle. We expand our query register to n qubits, but otherwise the gates in our quantum circuit are identical with the generalization that the Deutsch (Deutsch-Jozsa) gate acts on the entire query register. Thus, one must be very careful to consider all possible combinations for the available balanced and constant functions while constructing the inner workings of the blackbox."
