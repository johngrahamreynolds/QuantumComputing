        "## The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "For the general case of any integer $n > 1$, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can still solve this problem with only a single query to the oracle. We expand our query register to $n$ qubits, but otherwise the gates in our quantum circuit are identical with the generalization that the Deutsch gate (now called the Deutsch-Jozsa gate) acts on the entire $n$ qubit query register. Rather than considering all possible constant or balanced mappings from the domain $\\{0,1\\}^{n}$ to the target space $\\{0,1\\}$ (as we did in the case of $n=1$), we can instead simply have Bob secretly select from only a small subset of the possible functions. Trying to configure the blackbox to operate exactly on each $n$-bitstring input as we did before turns into a unwiedly task very, very quickly. We can examine this as follows.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the generalized case, there still exist only two constant functions: $f_{0}: \\{ 0,1\\}^n → \\{0\\}$ and $f_{1}: \\{ 0,1\\}^n → \\{1\\}$. The case of balanced functions is much trickier. Given $2^n$ possible bit strings, a balanced function must map exactly $2^{n-1}$ of these to $0$ and the other $2^{n-1}$ to $1$. That is, we have $2^{n}$ choose $2^{n-1}$ different ways of constructing a balanced function. We can define this mathematically with a function $f_b(n)$ that counts the number of possible balanced functions for any $n$ by expanding the binomial coefficient as  \n",
        "\n",
        "$ f_b(n) = { 2^{n} \\choose 2^{n-1}} = \\frac{2^{n}!}{2^{n-1}!(2^{n}-2^{n-1})!}$\n",
        "\n",
        "This function grows both exponentially and factorially. In the example of the simplified Deutsch algorithm from before we find the expected result of $f_b(1)=2$ as we saw in the truth table. For the next non-trivial cases beyond that, we have first a modest selection of $f_b(2) = 6$ and then a far less friendly $f_b(3) = 70$ possibilities for distinct balanced functions. Already for the case $n=9$ we have that $f_b(9) ≈ 10^{152}$, which is indeed approximately $10^{70}$ times larger than the current hypothetical upperbound on the number of atoms in the universe at ~ $10^{82}$ atoms. Forgetting for a brief second the restrictions of quantum mechanics and its associated trickery, even if one were to write down the exact domain to target space mapping (perhaps again in a truth table) of all possible balanced functions with a single atom for each mark in the case of $n=9$, one would be required access to not only every atom in our universe but also every atom in $10^{70}$ other universes of the same mass density. No further evidence should be required to demonstrate the futility of such a task.\n",
        "\n",
        "Returning now to our quantum mechanical reality and the problem at hand, we can allow Bob to secretly (without Alice's awareness) select just a small subset of the possible balanced functions for any $n$. In addition to the two constant maps, Bob can choose only two of the possible balanced functions. With careful consideration, his choices for the two balanced functions would appropriately force any classical computer's solution attempt to make exponentially more queries to the oracle than Alice's appropriately constructed quantum algorithm. Bob's choices can additionally find an exact analogue to the inner workings of the oracle in the case of $n=1$ as we will later see. Bob's first appropriate balanced function choice follows as a mapping which takes the first $2^{n-1}$ bit strings to $0$, and the last $2^{n-1}$ bit strings to $1$. Likewise, his second choice for a balanced function is the target value swapping of the former. With these four choices for functions, a classical computer would be required to make $2^{n-1} + 1$ queries to the oracle in order to discern the the global property of the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "tell the oracle the function's global property. As such, one removes the tedious process of considering all possible combinations for the available balanced and constant functions while constructing the inner workings of the blackbox in terms of quantum logic gates.\n",
